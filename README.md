Advice from Xpert AI:

-Corrected spelling and syntax for functions at JS line 60, correct use of ‘val’ method
-Corrected use of .val method at line 81 in renderSaved() function
-Corrected syntax for colorChange function



Advice from Ask BCS:
-JS line 60, corrected use of vanilla javascript to jquery. Helped with that syntax, use of “this” for DOM traversal

-Debugged syntax for colorChange and renderSaved functions in JS file

Collaboration/advice with class TA Walter Perry in office hours:

-Debugging and adding functions in JS line 61-79 to render localStorage correctly to the page
-Use of .each method in the colorChange function
